# RTOS-Benchmarking-with-PREEMPT_RT-on-Raspberry-Pi-4
This repository is dedicated to benchmarking and analyzing the performance of preemptive scheduling and semaphore operations on a Raspberry Pi 4 (RPi4) running a PREEMPT_RT kernel. It aims to assess the latency and overhead associated with real-time task management and semaphore operations in an RTOS environment.
